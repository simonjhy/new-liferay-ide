h1. Using Remote Liferay Servers

{toc}

h2. Requirements

* Liferay Portal 6.1.x (Tomcat, JBoss, or Glassfish bundles)
* Server Manager plugin 6.1.x installed into remote Liferay Portal

h2. Introduction

p. A Remote Liferay server is a special server adapter that works with a remote Liferay server instead of a local Liferay server bundle.  To use the Remote Server adapter, the Server Manager plugin must be installed into the remote server instance. The remote Liferay server must be running the Tomcat, JBoss or Glassfish server bundles. The Omni username/password will be used for connecting to the remote server from withing the Liferay IDE/Eclipse environment.

h2. Server Manager Plugin Setup

p. In order to use the Remote Liferay server feature in Liferay IDE, the Server Manager plugin needs to be installed into the remote Liferay server instance.  Below are the steps for installing the server manager plugin.

# Start the Liferay Server v6.1 Tomcat, JBoss or Glassfish bundle on the remote server
# "Download the latest version of the server-manager-web plugin from here.":http://sourceforge.net/projects/lportal/files/Liferay%20Plugins/
# Copy the server-manager-web-plugin war file into the auto-deploy folder on the remote server instance. (LIFERAY_HOME/deploy) 
# You should see a message about server-manager plugin war being deployed !images/remote-servers-1.png!

h2. Remote Liferay Server Adapter Setup

# Open New Server Wizard.. choose _File > New > Server > Server_ 
# Choose _Liferay > Remote Liferay Server_ <br/>!images/remote-servers-7.png!
# Or from toolbar dropdown <br/>!images/remote-servers-2.png!
# Specify a Liferay v6.x Runtime stub that will be used for runtime definition for projects that are deployed to remote server. This requires a local tomcat bundle of either 6.0 or 6.1 version of Liferay Portal Tomcat bundle.  Specify the location of an unzipped tomcat bundle. <br/>!images/remote-servers-3.png!
# On next page type in the correct IP address
# Specify http port that Liferay server is listening
# For username/password use the Omni admin username and password.
# Liferay context path is the context URI that Liferay portal is registered on, most likely the default can be used.
# Server manager context path is the context path for the deployed server-manager plugin, by default /server-manager-web <br/>!images/remote-servers-4.png!
# Click Finish
# You should see remote server log mssages printed to the console. <br/>!images/remote-servers-5.png!

h2. Deploy project to Remote Server

# Right click the Remote server and choose "Add / Remove" action to configure new projects to be published (deployed) to remote server.
# Once the project is deployed, you will see a message for deployment being successful in console. <br/>!images/remote-servers-8.png!
# Once any files or resources are changed, you will need to publish these changes by clicking the "publish" action in the Servers view, and a delta update will be sent to remote server.
# Remove a project from the server in the same way as with a local server, just right click the module and click "Remove".
